I want help in creating questions to verify actions in a schedule for a satellite.

There are 3 actions:
1. Taking of images
2. Processing of images
3. Downlinking of images and

'idle' that is created when no other actions can occur

Any of these actions can replace another within a satellite schedule apart from itself, the start times are shown in the file provided.
Note that idle cannot replace another action but can be replaced.

The column titled "Scheduled action" represents the actions scheduled with the respective time shown in column labeled start time.

The numbers for the Scheduled actions represents: 1 for processing, 2 for downlinking, 0 for taking of images, and -1 represents idle.

Here are 2 examples of types of questions

1. Is it possible for action A to occur at time t?
2. How many times is action B scheduled up to time t?
