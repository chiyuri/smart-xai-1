This is a problem for a satellite schedule.

This problem has several constraints for executing actions on a satellite.

There are 3 actions.
1. Image taking, can only occur when there is enough available memory onboard when land is visible (land_visibility), and when there is sunlight (daylight) exposure (this will use 2688 of the memory).
2. Processing, can only happen when there is enough available memory and when there are unprocessed images in memory (this will use 250 of the memory).
3. Downlinking, can only happen when there is access to a ground station (access) and there is at least 1 processed image in memory (will reduce the memory by 2800).

Idle, only occurs when no other action can take place (uses no memory).

pr_in_memory means processed instances in memory, therefore the number of images processed = pr_in_memory/10.57. Likewise for total_processed, means the total processed images up to that point (some may have been downloaded already)
im_in_mem means "images in memory" This means that some of these images may be processed, so to determine the unprocessed images, it would be "im_in_mem - (pr_in_memory/10.75)"
current_capacity represents the current memory used, im_total_taken is the total number of images that have been taken up to that point (some may have been processed and downloaded already)
Maximum memory (max_capacity) cannot be exceeded at any point in time which is 1920000.

"daylight", "land_visibility", and "access" are represented as only True or False

Taking of images is independent of images in memory as images in memory is only required for downlinking. Only the current_capacity and maximum memory, along with land visibility and sunlight can impact when images can be taken


Only 1 action can be executed at each start time.

Each action only last for 1 time interval.

The time is in hh mm ss, so it is the same as the question just a different format.

Please provide a direct and short answer to the question based on these conditions and using the support file.
