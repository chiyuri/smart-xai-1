This is a template code using TypeDB to extract and get all data from a dataset created for a schedule to create a knowledge graph.

If there is a question asking for an explanation, only create an algorithm for the Knowledge Graph.

This template is fixed and only the variable definition and the 'get' statement can be amended but must maintain the same variable labels.

All variables pertaining to the questions should be defined at the beginning, after the "match" clause:

for example. What would happen if time was 26 seconds? Time would be written like this 2020-12-03T00:00:26;
Using the same year-month-day and time format. The code would be written like this:

Note: $st should only be used if the question specifies it, otherwise should be removed.
Additionally, if there are any questions with a range of variables (you should use the start time ($st)), the same variable should be used and written like this:
$st >= a;
$st <= b;

Also if there is a question stating how many times is it possible for 'a', the "count" statement should be written after the "get" statement
for example, how many times is ground station accessible?
$g isa ground_station, has access $ac;
get $ac; count;

Additionally when asked about MB, multiply by 1000000\\

All times requested are in seconds for the fixed day of 2020-12-03, so they must be converted to the correct format for example time 2251 is written as 2020-12-03T00:37:32

If there is a question about swapping actions, at a specific time, only consider the conditions for that specific time



match
    $st = 2020-12-03T00:00:26;
    $a isa  action, has name $n, has a_timestamp $at;
    $ret isa $ret-type;
    {$n contains 'processed'; $x isa processed, has $ret; $ret-type type pr_in_memory;} or
    {$n contains 'image'; $x isa image, has $ret; $ret-type type im_in_memory; } or
    {$n contains 'downlink'; $x isa downlinked, has $ret; $ret-type type total_sent;};
    $pt($x,$mem) isa contents;
    $g isa ground_station, has access $ac, has $id;
    $env isa environment, has land_visibility $lv, has daylight $d, has latitude $lat, has longitude $lon;
    $sat isa satellite;
    $mem isa memory_unit, has current_capacity $cc, has $id, has max_capacity $max;
    $t($a,$sat) isa schedule;
    $l($mem,$sat) isa installation;
    $sa($g,$env) isa station_access;
    $loc($sat,$env) isa localisation, has start $st, has end $en; # localisation
    get $n, $at, $ret, $pt, $ac, $lv, $d, $lat, $lon, $l,  $sa, $t, $loc, $id, $mem, $g, $cc, $max, $st, $en;

Here is another example:
What would happen if ID was 7? rewrite the code

match
    $id = 7;
    $a isa action, has name $n, has a_timestamp $at;
    $ret isa $ret-type;
    {$n contains 'processed'; $x isa processed, has $ret; $ret-type type pr_in_memory;} or
    {$n contains 'image'; $x isa image, has $ret; $ret-type type im_in_memory; } or
    {$n contains 'downlink'; $x isa downlinked, has $ret; $ret-type type total_sent;};
    $pt($x,$mem) isa contents;
    $g isa ground_station, has access $ac, has $id;
    $env isa environment, has land_visibility $lv, has daylight $d, has latitude $lat, has longitude $lon;
    $sat isa satellite;
    $mem isa memory_unit, has current_capacity $cc, has $id, has max_capacity $max;
    $t($a,$sat) isa schedule;
    $l($mem,$sat) isa installation;
    $sa($g,$env) isa station_access;
    $loc($sat,$env) isa localisation, has start $st, has end $en; # localisation
    get $n, $at, $ret, $pt, $ac, $lv, $d, $lat, $lon, $l,  $sa, $t, $loc, $id, $mem, $g, $cc, $max, $st, $en;

create a knowledge graph based on the question and the code template provided.
