## Earth Observation Case study

This Repository contains the code for a simple manual schedule, an updated schedule using Google-OR-Tools using the 
initially created schedule, thus in combination generating a heuristic OPTIMAL schedule. In addition,
Abstract Argumentation (AA) was applied to the schedule that is contained within.

Within this project there are 3 main sub repositories.

- ## Environment
This file contains the coordinates of the satellite and the code used to determine day, 
night and land exposure.


- ## Offline schedule
This folder contains the code used to generate an offline schedule for heuristic with a suggested input 
from the end user.

- ## Argumentation
This file currently contains the Argumentation techniques applied to the the simple satellite schedule.

- ## Knowledge Graphs
This repository currently contains a Knowledge Graph (KG) technique applied to the simple satellite scheduling problem.
